# üîê Smart Door Lock Using RFID with Push Notifications

## üìå Project Description

This project is a **smart door lock system** that uses **RFID technology** for access control and integrates with **Pushbullet** and **PushingBox** to provide real-time notifications.

When an authorized RFID tag is scanned, the system:
- Unlocks the door using a **servo motor**
- Sends an **instant push notification** to the user's phone via **Pushbullet** (triggered using **PushingBox**)

This enhances home or office security by enabling **contactless entry** and keeping the owner informed about every access attempt.

## üîß Features

- RFID-based authentication
- Real-time push notification to mobile
- Servo motor for locking/unlocking
- Integrates with PushingBox and Pushbullet
- Low-cost and easy to build

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Node MCU ESP8266
- RFID Module (RC522)
- Servo Motor
- PushingBox
- Pushbullet
